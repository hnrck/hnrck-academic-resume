abstract: This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical Systems
  (CPS) simulations. In this paper, we consider distributed CPS simulations, for which
  there are strong constraints on the interaction of simulation components. In our
  previous work, we suggested a method to estimate a simulation scheduling on a given
  architecture and to verify constraints a priori. Trying to integrate these components
  manually is very time consuming, and can lead to mistakes. We introduce a tool to
  make an automatic allocation and scheduling of CPS simulation. We base this on the
  real-time scheduling literature and adopt a heuristic-based approach, adapted to
  our framework. We then present a complete case study, including simulations and
  the physical architecture of the simulations, and we illustrate the generation of
  the scheduling with different heuristics.
