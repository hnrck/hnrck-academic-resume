 abstract = {This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) simulations. In this paper, we consider distributed CPS simulations, for which there are strong constraints on the interaction of simulation components. In our previous work, we suggested a method to estimate a simulation scheduling on a given architecture and to verify constraints a priori. Trying to integrate these components manually is very time consuming, and can lead to mistakes. We introduce a tool to make an automatic allocation and scheduling of CPS simulation. We base this on the real-time scheduling literature and adopt a heuristic-based approach, adapted to our framework. We then present a complete case study, including simulations and the physical architecture of the simulations, and we illustrate the generation of the scheduling with different heuristics.},
