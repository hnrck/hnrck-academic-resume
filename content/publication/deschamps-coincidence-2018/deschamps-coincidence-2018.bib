 abstract = {This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) simulations.
We focus on a distributed simulations architecture for CPS, where the running simulators exist in concurrent and sequential domains. This architecture of simulation allows the expression of structural and behavioral constraints on the simulation. We call scheduling of simulation the temporal organization of the simulators interconnection.
In this paper we address the problem of the interconnected simulations representativity. To do so, we highlight the similarities and differences between task scheduling and simulation scheduling, and then we discuss the constraints expressible over that simulation scheduling. Finally, we illustrate a constraint on simulation scheduling with an extension of the open source case study ROSACE, implemented with CERTI, a compliant High-Level Architecture (HLA) RunTime Infrastructure (RTI). HLA is an IEEE standard for distributed simulation.},
