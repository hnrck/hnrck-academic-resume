 abstract = {This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) simulations. These systems are
distributed real-time systems, and their simulations might be distributed or not. 
In this paper, we propose a model to describe the modular components forming a simulation of a CPS. The main goal is to introduce a model of generic simulation distributed architecture, on which we are able to execute a logical architecture of simulation. This architecture of simulation allows the expression of structural and behavioural constraints on the simulation, abstracting its execution.
We will propose two implementations of the execution architecture based on generic architectures of distributed simulation:
• The High Level Architecture (HLA), an IEEE standard for distributed simulation, and one of its open-source implementation of RunTime Infrastructure (RTI): CERTI.
• The Distributed Simulation Scheduler (DSS), an Airbus framework scheduling predefined models.
Finally, we present the initial results obtained applying our formalism to the open-source case study from the ROSACE case study.},
