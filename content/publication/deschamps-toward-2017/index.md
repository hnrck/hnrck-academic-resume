abstract: 'This paper presents ongoing work on the formalism of Cyber-Physical Systems
  (CPS) simulations. These systems are distributed real-time systems, and their simulations
  might be distributed or not.  In this paper, we propose a model to describe the
  modular components forming a simulation of a CPS. The main goal is to introduce
  a model of generic simulation distributed architecture, on which we are able to
  execute a logical architecture of simulation. This architecture of simulation allows
  the expression of structural and behavioural constraints on the simulation, abstracting
  its execution. We will propose two implementations of the execution architecture
  based on generic architectures of distributed simulation: • The High Level Architecture
  (HLA), an IEEE standard for distributed simulation, and one of its open-source implementation
  of RunTime Infrastructure (RTI): CERTI. • The Distributed Simulation Scheduler (DSS),
  an Airbus framework scheduling predefined models. Finally, we present the initial
  results obtained applying our formalism to the open-source case study from the ROSACE
  case study.'
