 abstract = {Cyber-physical systems are systems that couple both elements from numerical computing and physical elements.
Systems containing a control loop in order to drive a vehicle in a real environment can be considered as a cyber-physical system. Aircrafts fit into this category.

The uses of simulation in conception and validation phases are more and more important, due to increasing complexity of embedded systems in aircrafts.
In order to receive the full benefit of a test realised in simulated environment, one must prove that the simulated system is valid.
Certain tests obliged simulated aircrafts to impose a reproducibility guarantee. These guarantee does not exist in real aircrafts, which have non reproducible behaviors.},
