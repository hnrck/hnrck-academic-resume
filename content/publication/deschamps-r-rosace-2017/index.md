abstract: In the aeornautical domain, simulation is becom- ing more and more important
  in the development and validation of systems, as well as for its usage in pilote
  training. Generally speaking, a simulation of a Cyber- Physical System is an aggregation
  of models belong- ing to the physical world (for instance, the flight dy- namic),
  and models belonging to the discrete world (for instance, controllers). Those models
  being inter- conected. Irrespective of the quality of the models simulated, their
  executions and interactions must reflect the real- ity sufficiently well to be considered
  representative. The goal of this paper is to introduce an extension to the ROSACE
  case study by taking into account con- trollers redundancy. We named this new case
  study R-ROSACE (R for redundant). R-ROSACE will allow a deeper study on communication
  and execution of simulated embedded systems, as well as their interac- tions with
  the simulated physical world. Keywords â€” simulation, scheduling, CPS
