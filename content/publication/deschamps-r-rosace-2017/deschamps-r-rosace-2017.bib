 abstract = {In the aeornautical domain, simulation is becom-
ing more and more important in the development and
validation of systems, as well as for its usage in pilote
training.
Generally speaking, a simulation of a Cyber-
Physical System is an aggregation of models belong-
ing to the physical world (for instance, the flight dy-
namic), and models belonging to the discrete world
(for instance, controllers). Those models being inter-
conected.
Irrespective of the quality of the models simulated,
their executions and interactions must reflect the real-
ity sufficiently well to be considered representative.
The goal of this paper is to introduce an extension
to the ROSACE case study by taking into account con-
trollers redundancy. We named this new case study
R-ROSACE (R for redundant). R-ROSACE will allow
a deeper study on communication and execution of
simulated embedded systems, as well as their interac-
tions with the simulated physical world.
