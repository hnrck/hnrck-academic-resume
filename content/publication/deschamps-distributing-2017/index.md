abstract: 'The goal of this position paper is to contribute for the improving of Cyber-Physical
  System (CPS) simulations by introducing distribution. CPS use computations and communication
  tightly interacting with physical processes. So a CPS simulation needs to tackle
  with three kinds of simulations: the computational simulation, the physical simulation,
  and the communication simulation. In this paper, we will focus on the communication
  simulation, and its interaction with the two others simulations. We will draw a
  landscape of the existing concepts and technologies for distributing communication
  simulation, and then propose an architecture for interacting with the whole CPS
  simulation. We will apply this architecture to a simulation of a satellite constellation,
  where satellites can be simulated with different levels of precision, from the simple
  generic mathematical model to the heavy-featured CPS simulation.'
