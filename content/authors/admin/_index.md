French :fr: computer science and network Ph.D. and engineer:man:‚Äç:computer:, I am Interested in real-time distributed software and systems :computer::cloud::computer::flight_departure:.

Distributed systems are nowadays inevitable in the field of engineering, no system lives alone isolated from its environment, even among systems that were historically considered monolithic, which raises questions about resource sharing, reliability, and data partitioning.

Although each problem requires a customized solution, my preferred approach consists in respecting the partitions and dividing a system into components that can be interconnected by a framework, whatever the scale of this interconnection, from embedded networks to international distribution.
Such an approach makes it possible to apply good industrial software practices while addressing emerging problems from networks and system states.

I have experienced this modular approach in software and systems, and I had the opportunity to develop it on the simulation of critical cyber-physical systems that can integrate humans, software and hardware.
